'''
Gyroscope module

The following functions are required to be implemented:

1. read_gyroscope() - To be implemented: Read data from the gyroscope/accelerometer
    - This function return data of gyroscope/accelerometer
    - Return value is used in check_fall_condition() as gyro_data
2. check_fall_condition() - To be implemented: Placeholder function to process gyroscope data and determine fall
    - Return True if fall detected
    - Return False otherwise
    - If the person fall and remain stay at that state, keep return True until normal motion is detected

Those functions will be called by the main program (FallAlert/main.py)
